//! ACTS authentication support.
//!
//! Five ACTS tests assert that an agent requiring a credential rejects a
//! request that lacks one. A2A conditions that obligation on the agent's own
//! declared requirements, so those tests gate on a card declaring
//! `securitySchemes` and `securityRequirements` — an agent declaring neither is
//! not violating anything by serving an unauthenticated request. Every ITK
//! agent declares neither by default, because traversal peers dial it with no
//! credential.
//!
//! Enforcement is therefore opt-in, and the ACTS runner turns it on for a
//! separate pass over just those tests. It cannot be on for the main pass: raw
//! steps are sent exactly as written, so an absent `Authorization` header means
//! "reject me" in `SEC-AUTH-001` and "serve me" in `JSONRPC-ENV-001`, and no
//! server can tell those two requests apart.
//!
//! The extended card is the exception, guarded in either mode: A2A §13.3 makes
//! its authentication unconditional, and no traversal scenario fetches one.
